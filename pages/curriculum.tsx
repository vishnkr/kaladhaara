        Kaladhaara's approach to teaching Bharatanatyam is based on providing a wholesome experience that 
        includes learning form and technique, foundational theory of dance, understanding the cultural 
        significance, fostering creativity, all the while making it an enjoyable experience for the students. 
        </p>
        <p className='mt-8 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl text-center leading-8 text-gray-600'>
        Based on the student's age and level, they are placed into groups with similar learning abilities. 
        These group classes and practice sessions often help students form strong friendships, learning from each other and progressing as a group. 
        Through these classes, the students learn important values like perseverance, determination, discipline, 
        time management while enjoying the learning experience.<br />
        </p>
        <h3 className='text-center my-3 text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl '>Here is a sample of what some of these groups work on </h3>

        Every summer, Kaladhaara hosts multiple week-long workshops where students learn special choreographic works from traveling artists & professionals from the Industry or thematic projects and have an opportunity to perform in the summer showcase. These are also accompanied by â€œAdavuthon'' sessions to prepare the students for the intense workshop experience. In addition to these, students at Kaladhaara are given some additional choreography challenges to deepen their quest if they want to be challenged and raise the bar they set for themselves.  
       </p>
       <p className='mt-8 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl text-center leading-8 text-gray-600'>
        We are also working on creating avenues for students that transition into post arangetram learning which includes applying for scholarship, external performances and refining their progress. Kaladhaara embarked on their first tour of Natyanjali festivities in India during Feb-March 2020 where five of the students and their families traveled with Mathura to perform at various temples across Tamil Nadu for MahaShivarathri.
